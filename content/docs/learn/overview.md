In recent months, the world of AI has changed drastically. The impact of the
general availability of Large Language Models, like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Bard](https://bard.google.com/), and [Dolly](https://www.databricks.com/product/machine-learning/large-language-models)
is hard to overstate. These only complement existing techniques in
image generation, classification, speech recognition, and many others. At the
time of writing this post, [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models), the leading repository of models, has more than 200,000 of them! The challenge is how to 
integrate these techniques into a broader system. AI is not a goal in itself but
a tool in your journey to offer the best experience to your customers.

The possibilities are endless: Summarize the most important events in the
customer's account. Generate queries to the database from a natural language
description. Help customer service provide a sequence of steps to resolve an
issue. Identify the important parts of a PDF invoice. These are tasks where AI
can make an impact *now*.

However, the ecosystem is quite fragmented, usually requiring a different library for
each different service. This is where [xef.ai](https://xef.ai) enters the game:
a project whose goal is to offer a convenient interface to these modern AI
techniques so your team can quickly move from ideas to proofs of concepts to 
integrating AI into your business processes.

Just bring xef.ai in your project, connect it to the right AI models and data sources, and start asking questions.
